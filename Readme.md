# 🍽️ Swiggy Clone using Live API

> React, Redux, SPA

Developed a frontend clone of Swiggy using React as a Single Page Application (SPA). Integrated Swiggy’s public API to deliver a dynamic, real-time food ordering interface.

- Used real-time API to fetch restaurant/menu data — no hardcoded content.
- Implemented async data fetching with **async/await** for smooth rendering.
- Bypassed CORS using a custom proxy server to modify request headers.
- Built seamless SPA routing with **react-router-dom**.
- Managed global cart state using Redux for real-time UI updates.
- Added in-restaurant dish search using live filtering on local array.
- Included Veg/Non-Veg filters via toggle control.
